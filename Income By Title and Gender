/*  Problem Statement

Find the average total compensation based on employee titles and gender. Total compensation 
is calculated by adding both the salary and bonus of each employee. However, not every employee 
receives a bonus so disregard employees without bonuses in your calculation. Employee can 
receive more than one bonus.  

Output the employee title, gender (i.e., sex), along with the average total compensation.
